# Kubernetes WASM Operator

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can follow the instructions available in the https://github.com/wasm-orchestration/wasm-orchestration-scripts repository.

### Running on the cluster

1. Configure the necessary settings for your Redis instance by editing `util/utils.go`.

2. Create the necesssary manifests:

```sh
make manifests 
```

3. Deploy the operator:

```sh
make deploy
```

4. Run in foreground

```sh
make run
```

### Building a Docker Image

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kube-spin:tag
```
	
2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kube-spin:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
